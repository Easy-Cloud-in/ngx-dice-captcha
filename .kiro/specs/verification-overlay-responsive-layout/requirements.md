# Requirements Document: Control Overlay Responsive Layout

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for making the **control-overlay component** (the input overlay where users enter dice values and sum) responsive based on screen size. Currently, the control overlay uses a fixed layout that can overflow on small screens (< 785px). The improvement will automatically position the overlay vertically on the left side for mobile/small screens and horizontally at the top for larger screens.

This enhancement will ensure the control overlay displays properly within the canvas boundaries across all device sizes, providing an optimal user experience without content overflow.

**Important:** This feature ONLY modifies the control-overlay component. No other components (verification-display, dice-canvas, etc.) will be changed. This ensures backward compatibility and prevents breaking existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automatic Control Overlay Layout Detection

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the control overlay (dice input form) to automatically adapt its layout based on my screen size, so that the input fields and buttons are always fully visible and properly positioned within the canvas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the canvas width is less than 785px THEN the overlay SHALL use a vertical left-aligned layout
2. WHEN the canvas width is 785px or greater THEN the overlay SHALL use a horizontal top-center layout
3. WHEN the canvas is resized across the 785px threshold THEN the overlay layout SHALL update automatically
4. WHEN the layout changes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth without visual glitches
5. IF a verification result is currently displayed THEN resizing SHALL maintain the overlay visibility
6. WHEN the layout is determined THEN it SHALL be based on the canvas container width, not viewport width
7. WHEN the overlay layout changes THEN all content SHALL remain readable and accessible
8. WHEN the canvas is embedded in a small container THEN the overlay SHALL detect the container size correctly
9. WHEN multiple captcha instances exist THEN each SHALL independently determine its layout
10. WHEN the layout is calculated THEN it SHALL execute within 50ms of size detection

### Requirement 2: Vertical Left-Aligned Layout for Small Screens

**User Story:** As a mobile user or user with a narrow screen (< 785px), I want the verification overlay to display vertically on the left side of the canvas, so that all content fits within the visible area without horizontal scrolling or overflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the canvas width is less than 785px THEN the overlay SHALL position at the left edge of the canvas
2. WHEN using vertical layout THEN the overlay SHALL align to the top-left corner with minimal padding
3. WHEN using vertical layout THEN the overlay card SHALL take full width of the canvas minus minimal margins
4. WHEN using vertical layout THEN all content SHALL stack vertically (icon, title, message, dice values, buttons)
5. WHEN using vertical layout THEN buttons SHALL stack vertically with full width
6. WHEN using vertical layout THEN the dice values grid SHALL use 2 columns maximum
7. WHEN using vertical layout THEN font sizes SHALL scale down appropriately (title: 1rem, message: 0.75rem)

9. WHEN using vertical layout THEN padding SHALL be minimal (0.25rem overlay, 0.5rem card)
10. WHEN using vertical layout THEN the overlay SHALL be scrollable if content exceeds canvas height

### Requirement 3: Horizontal Top-Center Layout for Large Screens

**User Story:** As a desktop user or user with a wide screen (â‰¥ 785px), I want the verification overlay to display horizontally at the top-center of the canvas, so that it doesn't obstruct the dice and provides a traditional centered modal experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the canvas width is 785px or greater THEN the overlay SHALL position at the top-center of the canvas
2. WHEN using horizontal layout THEN the overlay SHALL be centered horizontally
3. WHEN using horizontal layout THEN the overlay card SHALL have a maximum width of 500px

5. WHEN using horizontal layout THEN the dice values grid SHALL use auto-fit columns
6. WHEN using horizontal layout THEN font sizes SHALL use standard sizing (title: 1.5rem, message: 1rem)
7. WHEN using horizontal layout THEN icon size SHALL be 64px
8. WHEN using horizontal layout THEN padding SHALL be standard (0.5rem overlay, 1rem card)
9. WHEN using horizontal layout THEN the overlay SHALL center vertically within the canvas
10. WHEN using horizontal layout THEN the card SHALL have standard elevation and shadows

### Requirement 4: Responsive Content Scaling

8. WHEN the layout is horizontal THEN button text SHALL be 0.875rem font size
9. WHEN the layout is vertical THEN dice value numbers SHALL be 1rem font size
10. WHEN the layout is horizontal THEN dice value numbers SHALL be 1.5rem font size

### Requirement 5: Dice Values Display Adaptation

**User Story:** As a user viewing verification results, I want the dice values to be displayed in a grid that adapts to the available space, so that I can easily see all dice values without scrolling horizontally.
