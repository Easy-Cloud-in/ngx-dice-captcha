# Requirements Document: Responsive Improvements for ngx-dice-captcha

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving the responsiveness of the ngx-dice-captcha library across different screen sizes and devices. The improvements focus on three main areas:

1. **Dynamic 3D Scene Scaling** - Making the Three.js scene (ground plane, boundary walls, dice) adapt to different screen sizes
2. **Dice Result Display Positioning** - Ensuring the dice results always appear in the bottom-right corner of the canvas
3. **Enhanced Mobile Experience** - Improving the overall responsiveness for mobile devices and ultra-wide displays

These improvements will ensure the library provides a consistent, high-quality user experience across all device types and screen sizes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 0: Dice Value Reading Accuracy Across All Screen Sizes

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the dice face values to be read accurately 100% of the time regardless of screen size, so that the CAPTCHA verification works reliably on mobile phones, tablets, desktops, and ultra-wide displays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dice come to rest THEN the face value detection SHALL be 100% accurate on screens from 320px to 3840px width
2. WHEN dice are scaled (0.7x to 1.5x) THEN the quaternion-based face detection SHALL produce identical results
3. WHEN the canvas is resized during dice roll THEN the face value reading SHALL not be affected
4. WHEN dice land on mobile devices (320px-768px) THEN face values SHALL be detected with 100% accuracy
5. WHEN dice land on tablets (768px-1024px) THEN face values SHALL be detected with 100% accuracy
6. WHEN dice land on desktops (1024px-2560px) THEN face values SHALL be detected with 100% accuracy
7. WHEN dice land on ultra-wide displays (>2560px) THEN face values SHALL be detected with 100% accuracy
8. WHEN face normals are compared against up vector THEN the calculation SHALL be scale-independent
9. WHEN dice rotation is read from physics body THEN the quaternion values SHALL be accurate regardless of dice size
10. WHEN multiple dice are rolled simultaneously THEN all face values SHALL be read correctly on all screen sizes

### Requirement 1: Dynamic 3D Scene Scaling and Dice Containment

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the 3D dice scene to scale appropriately to my screen size, so that the dice always roll and land completely within the visible canvas area, with the ground plane and boundaries properly adjusted to contain them at all times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the canvas container is resized THEN the ground plane SHALL update its dimensions to match the new scene scale
2. WHEN the canvas container is resized THEN the boundary walls SHALL reposition to contain the dice within the visible canvas area
3. WHEN dice are rolled THEN they SHALL always land within the visible canvas boundaries on all screen sizes
4. WHEN the canvas container is resized THEN the scene scale calculation SHALL execute within 150ms of the resize event
5. WHEN the ground plane is updated THEN the old geometry SHALL be properly disposed to prevent memory leaks
6. WHEN boundary walls are repositioned THEN the physics bodies SHALL be recreated with correct dimensions and positioned to prevent dice from escaping
7. IF the canvas aspect ratio changes THEN the scene scale SHALL recalculate using FOV-based trigonometry to ensure dice remain visible
8. WHEN scene elements are updated THEN the physics simulation SHALL maintain integrity without dice escaping boundaries
9. WHEN dice are in motion THEN the boundary walls SHALL prevent them from rolling outside the visible canvas area
10. WHEN the ground plane is scaled THEN it SHALL be sized to match the visible viewport area with appropriate padding

### Requirement 2: Proportional Dice Scaling and Value Reading Accuracy

**User Story:** As a user viewing the CAPTCHA on different screen sizes, I want the dice to scale proportionally with the canvas size and maintain accurate face value detection, so that they remain clearly visible, appropriately sized, and the dice values are read correctly on my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the canvas size changes THEN the dice SHALL scale proportionally between 0.7x and 1.5x of their base size
2. WHEN dice are scaled THEN the physics bodies SHALL update to match the visual mesh size exactly
3. WHEN dice are scaled THEN the face value detection algorithm SHALL remain accurate regardless of scale
4. WHEN dice come to rest THEN the face value reading SHALL be 100% accurate on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop, ultra-wide)
5. WHEN dice are scaled THEN the texture quality SHALL remain sharp without pixelation
6. IF the dice are currently rolling THEN scaling SHALL be deferred until they come to rest
7. WHEN dice scaling occurs THEN the dice state (position, rotation, velocity) SHALL be preserved
8. WHEN the canvas is smaller than 600px width THEN dice SHALL scale down to maintain visibility while preserving value reading accuracy
9. WHEN the canvas is larger than 1400px width THEN dice SHALL scale up to fill the space appropriately while maintaining accurate face detection
10. WHEN dice face values are calculated THEN the quaternion-based detection SHALL work identically at any scale factor

### Requirement 3: Fixed Dice Results Display Position
