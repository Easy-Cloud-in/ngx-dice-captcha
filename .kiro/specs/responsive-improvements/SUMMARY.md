## üìû Questions to Consider

Before starting implementation, please confirm:

1. ‚úÖ Is 100% dice value reading accuracy across all screen sizes acceptable as a requirement?
2. ‚úÖ Is 0 dice escapes (100% containment) acceptable as a requirement?
3. ‚úÖ Are the validation methods and debug logging sufficient?
4. ‚úÖ Is the 6-week timeline still acceptable with enhanced testing?
5. ‚úÖ Are there any additional screen sizes or devices to test?

If you're satisfied with the spec, you can begin implementation! üé≤
