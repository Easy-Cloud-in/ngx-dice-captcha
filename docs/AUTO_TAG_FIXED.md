# Auto-Tag Workflow Fixed

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed and Ready

---

## The Problem

The auto-tag workflow was checking for the NPM token and silently exiting when it thought the token wasn't configured. This caused:

- ❌ No tags being created automatically
- ❌ No GitHub releases being created
- ❌ No automatic NPM publishing
- ✅ But manual workflow trigger worked fine

## The Root Cause

The workflow had a token check that would `exit 0` (success) if the token wasn't found:

```yaml
- name: Check NPM Token Configuration
  run: |
    if [ -z "${{ secrets.NGX_DICE_CAPTCHA }}" ]; then
      echo "❌ Token not configured"
      exit 0  # This made GitHub think it succeeded!
    fi
```

This meant:

- Workflow appeared to succeed ✅
- But didn't actually do anything
- No error emails sent
- No tags created

## The Fix

Removed the token check entirely since we know the token works (manual publish succeeded). The workflow now:

1. ✅ Always runs when `projects/ngx-dice-captcha/package.json` changes
2. ✅ Checks if tag already exists (prevents duplicates)
3. ✅ Creates tag and release if new version
4. ✅ Triggers NPM publish workflow automatically

---

## How It Works Now

### Automatic Publishing Flow

```
1. Update version in projects/ngx-dice-captcha/package.json
   ↓
2. Commit and push to main
   ↓
3. Auto-tag workflow triggers
   ├─ Read version from package.json
   ├─ Check if tag v2.0.X exists
   │  ├─ Exists → Skip (show summary)
   │  └─ New → Continue
   ├─ Create Git tag v2.0.X
   ├─ Push tag to GitHub
   └─ Create GitHub release
   ↓
4. NPM publish workflow triggers (on release created)
   ├─ Build library
   ├─ Check if version exists on NPM
   ├─ Publish to NPM
   └─ Publish to GitHub Packages
   ↓
5. Package live on npmjs.com! 🎉
```

## Test the Fix

### Step 1: Update Version

```bash
# Edit projects/ngx-dice-captcha/package.json
# Change "version": "2.0.4" to "version": "2.0.5"
```

### Step 2: Commit and Push

```bash
git add .github/workflows/auto-tag.yml projects/ngx-dice-captcha/package.json docs/
git commit -m "fix: remove token check from auto-tag workflow and bump to v2.0.5"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Watch It Work

1. Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ngx-dice-captcha/actions
2. Watch "Auto Tag and Release" workflow run
3. Should see:
   - ✅ Read version: 2.0.5
   - ✅ Tag doesn't exist
   - ✅ Create tag v2.0.5
   - ✅ Create release
4. Then "Publish to NPM" workflow triggers automatically
5. Wait 3-4 minutes
6. Check: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-dice-captcha

## What Changed in the Workflow

### Before (Broken):

```yaml
- name: Check NPM Token
  run: |
    if [ -z "${{ secrets.NGX_DICE_CAPTCHA }}" ]; then
      exit 0  # Silent exit
    fi

- name: Create tag
  if: steps.check-npm.outputs.configured == 'true' # Never ran
  run: ...
```

### After (Fixed):

```yaml
- name: Read version
  run: ...

- name: Check if tag exists
  run: ...

- name: Create tag
  if: steps.should-tag.outputs.create == 'true' # Always runs when needed
  run: ...
```

## Benefits

✅ **Fully Automatic** - Just update version and push  
✅ **No Manual Steps** - No need to manually trigger workflows  
✅ **Duplicate Prevention** - Won't create duplicate tags  
✅ **Clear Feedback** - Shows summary when tag already exists  
✅ **Reliable** - No silent failures

---

## Version Already Published?

Since you manually published v2.0.4, the tag v2.0.4 doesn't exist yet. You have two options:

### Option A: Create Tag for v2.0.4 (Retroactive)

```bash
git tag v2.0.4
git push origin v2.0.4

# Then create release on GitHub manually
# This documents that v2.0.4 was published
```

### Option B: Move to v2.0.5 (Recommended)

```bash
# Edit projects/ngx-dice-captcha/package.json
# Change to "version": "2.0.5"

git add projects/ngx-dice-captcha/package.json .github/workflows/
git commit -m "fix: auto-tag workflow and bump to v2.0.5"
git push origin main

# Everything will happen automatically!
```

---

## Monitoring

### Check Workflow Status

Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ngx-dice-captcha/actions

You should see:

- "Auto Tag and Release" - Runs on version change
- "Publish to NPM" - Runs after release created
- "CI" - Runs on every push

### Check Tags

```bash
# List all tags
git tag -l

# Should see:
# v1.0.0
# v2.0.4 (if you created it)
# v2.0.5 (after next push)
```

### Check Releases

Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ngx-dice-captcha/releases

Should see releases for each version.

### Check NPM

```bash
npm view ngx-dice-captcha versions

# Should show:
# [ '2.0.4', '2.0.5', ... ]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Tag already exists"

**This is normal!** The workflow skips creating duplicate tags.

**Solution:** Update to a new version number.

### Issue: Workflow doesn't trigger

**Check:**

1. Did you change `projects/ngx-dice-captcha/package.json`?
2. Did you push to `main` branch?
3. Check Actions tab for workflow runs

### Issue: Tag created but no NPM publish

**Check:**

1. Did the release get created on GitHub?
2. Check "Publish to NPM" workflow logs
3. Verify NGX_DICE_CAPTCHA secret is still valid
