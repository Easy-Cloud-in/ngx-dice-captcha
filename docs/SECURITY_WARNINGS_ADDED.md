5. **Education** - Teaches proper CAPTCHA security

### What We're NOT Doing

- ‚ùå Removing the library (it has educational value)
- ‚ùå Making it unusable (great for learning)
- ‚ùå Discouraging all use (appropriate for demos)
- ‚ùå Being alarmist (balanced, factual)

### What We ARE Doing

- ‚úÖ Being transparent about limitations
- ‚úÖ Educating users about security
- ‚úÖ Providing production alternatives
- ‚úÖ Offering improvement roadmap
- ‚úÖ Protecting users from misuse
