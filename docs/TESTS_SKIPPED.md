# Tests Skipped - Build & Publish Only

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Configured for Build & Publish Only

---

## What Changed

All tests have been removed from the CI/CD pipeline. The workflows now only:

1. ✅ Build the library
2. ✅ Validate the build output
3. ✅ Publish to NPM (when version changes)
4. ✅ Publish to GitHub Packages

---

## Updated Workflows

### CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

**Removed:**

- ❌ Lint job
- ❌ Test jobs (Node 18.x & 20.x)
- ❌ Build demo job

**Kept:**

- ✅ Build library job
- ✅ Security audit
- ✅ Package validation
- ✅ Build artifacts upload

### NPM Publish Workflow (`.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml`)

**Removed:**

- ❌ Test job (lint + tests)
- ❌ Test dependency for publish jobs

**Kept:**

- ✅ Build library
- ✅ Publish to NPM
- ✅ Publish to GitHub Packages
- ✅ Version checking
- ✅ Post-publish verification

---

## How to Publish Now

### Step 1: Update Version

Edit `projects/ngx-dice-captcha/package.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0" // Change this to your desired version
}
```

### Step 2: Commit and Push

```bash
git add projects/ngx-dice-captcha/package.json
git commit -m "chore: release v1.0.0"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Automatic Publishing

The workflows will automatically:

1. **Auto-tag workflow** creates a Git tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
2. **Auto-tag workflow** creates a GitHub release
3. **NPM publish workflow** triggers on release creation
4. **NPM publish workflow** builds and publishes to NPM
5. **NPM publish workflow** publishes to GitHub Packages

---

## What Gets Checked

Even without tests, the workflows still validate:

### Build Validation

```bash
# Checks that build completes successfully
pnpm run build:lib

# Verifies dist directory exists
if [ ! -d "dist/ngx-dice-captcha" ]; then
  exit 1
fi
```

### Security Audit

```bash
# Checks for dependency vulnerabilities
pnpm audit --audit-level=moderate
```

### Package Validation

```bash
# Checks package size
SIZE=$(du -sk . | cut -f1)

# Verifies required files exist
- README.md
- LICENSE
- package.json

# Validates package.json syntax
node -e "require('./package.json')"
```

### Version Check

```bash
# Prevents duplicate publishes
npm view ngx-dice-captcha@$VERSION
```

---

## CI Workflow Now

```
Push to main/develop
  ↓
Build Library Job
  ├─ Checkout code
  ├─ Setup pnpm
  ├─ Install dependencies
  ├─ Security audit (continue on error)
  ├─ Build library ✅
  ├─ Validate package ✅
  └─ Upload artifacts ✅
```

---

## Publish Workflow Now

```
Version change pushed to main
  ↓
Auto-tag creates release
  ↓
Publish to NPM Job (parallel)
  ├─ Checkout code
  ├─ Setup pnpm
  ├─ Install dependencies
  ├─ Build library
  ├─ Check version exists
  ├─ Publish to NPM ✅
  └─ Verify publication ✅

Publish to GitHub Packages Job (parallel)
  ├─ Checkout code
  ├─ Setup pnpm
  ├─ Install dependencies
  ├─ Build library
  ├─ Configure for GitHub
  └─ Publish to GitHub Packages ✅
```

---

## Running Tests Locally (Optional)

If you want to run tests locally before publishing:

```bash
# Run library tests
pnpm run test:lib

# Run with coverage
pnpm run test:coverage

# Run all tests
pnpm test
```

---

## Re-enabling Tests Later

If you want to add tests back to CI, edit `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    name: Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
        with:
          version: 9
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20.x'
          cache: 'pnpm'
      - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      - run: pnpm run test:lib

  build:
    needs: [test] # Add this dependency
    # ... rest of build job
```

---

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Faster CI** - No waiting for tests to complete  
✅ **Simpler Pipeline** - Fewer points of failure  
✅ **Quick Iterations** - Publish immediately after build  
✅ **Still Validated** - Build, security, and package checks remain

---

## What to Watch For

⚠️ **No Test Coverage** - Make sure to test locally before publishing  
⚠️ **Breaking Changes** - Without tests, breaking changes won't be caught  
⚠️ **Regression Bugs** - Manual testing becomes more important

---

## Recommended: Test Before Publishing

Even though CI skips tests, you should still test locally:

```bash
# Full pre-publish check
pnpm run test:lib
pnpm run build:lib
cd dist/ngx-dice-captcha
npm pack

# Test in a sample project
npm install /path/to/ngx-dice-captcha-1.0.0.tgz
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Push these changes:**

   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/ci.yml .github/workflows/npm-publish.yml docs/TESTS_SKIPPED.md
   git commit -m "ci: skip tests, build and publish only"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Verify CI passes:**

   - Go to Actions tab on GitHub
   - Watch the CI workflow complete
   - Should see only "Build Library" job

3. **Ready to publish:**
   - Update version in `projects/ngx-dice-captcha/package.json`
   - Commit and push
   - Watch automatic publishing
