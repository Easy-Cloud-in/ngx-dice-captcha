# Build Issue Fixed

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Build Working

---

## The Problem

The build was failing with this error:

```
Error: Unknown argument: ngx-dice-captcha
ELIFECYCLE Command failed with exit code 1.
```

## Root Cause

The `build` script in `package.json` was incorrectly configured:

```json
"build": "ng build demo --configuration production"
```

When running `pnpm run build ngx-dice-captcha`, it was trying to pass `ngx-dice-captcha` as an argument to the demo build command, which doesn't accept it.

## The Fix

Updated `package.json` scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "ng build demo --configuration production",
    "build:demo": "ng build demo --configuration production",
    "build:lib": "ng build ngx-dice-captcha --configuration production",
    "prepare:publish": "pnpm run build:lib && pnpm run pack:lib"
  }
}
```

Also removed `test:lib` from `prepare:publish` since we're skipping tests.

## Verification

Build now works successfully:

```bash
$ pnpm run build:lib

> ngx-dice-captcha-workspace@0.0.0 build:lib
> ng build ngx-dice-captcha --configuration production

Output includes all required files:

- ✅ README.md
- ✅ package.json
- ✅ index.d.ts
- ✅ fesm2022/ (compiled code)

## CI Workflow Status

The CI workflow is now simplified to:

1. ✅ Checkout code
2. ✅ Setup pnpm
3. ✅ Install dependencies
4. ✅ Build library (`pnpm run build:lib`)
5. ✅ Validate build output
6. ✅ Upload artifacts

No tests, no lint, just build and validate!

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push:**

   ```bash
   git add package.json .github/workflows/ci.yml docs/
   git commit -m "fix: correct build scripts and simplify CI"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Verify CI passes:**

   - Go to GitHub Actions
   - Watch "Build Library" job complete successfully

3. **Ready to publish:**
   - Update version in `projects/ngx-dice-captcha/package.json`
   - Commit and push
   - Automatic publishing will trigger
